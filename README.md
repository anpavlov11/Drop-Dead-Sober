# SOBER AF BLOG
## Description 
Welcome to the Sober AF Blog! To get the most out of the app, users should create an account. When creating an account the user will be asked to provide a username, email address and password. After creating an account, users will have access to the features of the blog.<br>
If a user tries to create an account with the same email address they will be redirected to the homepage instead.<br>
Once a user has an account they will have to log in each visit. Users will be able to reset their password when necessary.<br>
Users with accounts will be able to create blog posts and also edit and delete their posts. In addition, account holders will be able to read and comment on others blog posts.<br>
Only users who are logged in can create new posts and comment on others posts.<br>
The purpose of the blog is to allow alcoholics/addicts to connect and share their stories of recovery and for those who are struggling and want to recover. In future versions of the app, resources (treatment centers, meeting locations) will be available through links and Google Map APIs. Users will also be able to create profiles.
